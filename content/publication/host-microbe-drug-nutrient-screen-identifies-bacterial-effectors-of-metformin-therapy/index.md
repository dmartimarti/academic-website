abstract: Metformin is the first-line therapy for treating type 2 diabetes and a
  promising anti-aging drug. We set out to address the fundamental question of
  how gut microbes and nutrition, key regulators of host physiology, affect the
  effects of metformin. Combining two tractable genetic models, the bacterium E.
  coli and the nematode C. elegans, we developed a high-throughput four-way
  screen to define the underlying host-microbe-drug-nutrient interactions. We
  show that microbes integrate cues from metformin and the diet through the
  phosphotransferase signaling pathway that converges on the transcriptional
  regulator Crp. A detailed experimental characterization of metformin effects
  downstream of Crp in combination with metabolic modeling of the microbiota in
  metformin-treated type 2 diabetic patients predicts the production of
  microbial agmatine, a regulator of metformin effects on host lipid metabolism
  and lifespan. Our high-throughput screening platform paves the way for
  identifying exploitable drug-nutrient-microbiome interactions to improve host
  health and longevity through targeted microbiome therapies.
