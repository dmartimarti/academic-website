abstract: Microbes are an integral part of life on this planet. Microbes and
  their hosts influence each other in an endless dance that shapes how the
  meta-organism interacts with its environment. Although great advances have
  been made in microbiome research over the past 20 years, the mechanisms by
  which both hosts and their microbes interact with each other and the
  environment are still not well understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
  has been widely used as a model organism to study a remarkable number of
  human-like processes. Recent evidence shows that the worm is a powerful tool
  to investigate in fine detail the complexity that exists in microbe–host
  interactions. By combining the large array of genetic tools available for both
  organisms together with deep phenotyping approaches, it has been possible to
  uncover key effectors in the complex relationship between microbes and their
  hosts. In this perspective, we survey the literature for insightful
  discoveries in the microbiome field using the worm as a model. We discuss the
  latest conceptual and technological advances in the field and highlight the
  strengths that make C. elegans a valuable biosensor tool for the study of
  microbe–host interactions.
